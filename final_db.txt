In addition, they will also develop important communication, dispute resolution and critical thinking skills. The program is designed to provide graduates with foundational training to enable them to seek careers in the many industries and government agencies responsible for facilitating the movement of persons and goods across the borders.

In the Extremism & Fundamentalism in Canadian Society course, students examine the complexity and dynamics of political and religious fundamentalism using an integrated and interdisciplinary perspective.
Because the program is delivered in 12 straight months, many students return and take a second "fast track" law enforcement program, providing them with two relevant 2-year diplomas in just 2 years. This makes them even better candidates for hire in the field of law enforcement.

Graduate Testimonials
Civil Engineering Technology graduate, Mike McClellan (Alumni 1996), benefitted immensely from his time at St. Clair College. After graduating from the Civil program, he was lucky enough to be available when Alberici Constructors Ltd. called the College looking for recent graduates. They are a large international construction company with offices around the world, including its head office in Burlington, Ontario. Mike was recommended by one of his faculty, he went for the interview and was hired the next day.
He started as a Project Coordinator, and then quickly became Project Manager, and then Regional Manager of Windsor in a short period of time. “I worked hard and the company recognized that,” says McClellan. “My education at St. Clair provided a wonderful foundation to enter this industry. The program taught a little bit about everything which is great for career advancement.” His career path within the company took him into a Project Manager's position on some big work in Toronto, then Director of Operations - Industrial, then to his current role as Construction Manager in New Orleans.
In this capacity, he is responsible for all field operations on the project. He manages five superintendents reporting to him with about 300 workers reporting to them through foremen. His responsibilities include safety, costing, scheduling and quality of all field work. When asked what advice he would give students interested in the program, he replied, “Do everything they can to be leaders. In today's workforce, most people do not want to take responsibility. Companies quickly recognize the work of those who are self starters. Civil is very broad based. General contracting, surveying and inspection and testing are careers the program prepares people for.”

Program Overview
This program provides students with key concepts of information security, technical and practical job skills necessary to secure, protect and defend network infrastructures and an organization's valuable data assets.
The curriculum provides a broad understanding of cybersecurity concepts, industry best practices for information security and key security concepts that will protect an organization against fraud, data breaches and other vulnerabilities. The program is designed to prepare information and digital security professionals with the ability to manage, provide policies, standards, procedures, guidelines, and policy framework, assess and mitigate risk and integrate advanced security solutions.
The growing Internet security sector requires an in-depth understanding of cybersecurity issues, fundamental Internet architecture and protocols. In addition, network security skills such as packet, vulnerability, exploit analysis, and cybersecurity research are also discussed. This program focuses on the vulnerabilities of automobiles and other methods of transportation. Graduates will develop highly marketable skills that are required in the cybersecurity field, especially with automotive firms.
Career Opportunities
Information or system security analysts analyze and test systems requirements, develop and implement information systems development plans, policies, and procedures, and provide advice on a wide range of information systems issues. They are employed in information technology consulting firms and in information technology units throughout the public and private sectors, or they may be self-employed.
Graduates of this program may typically find employment in both the automotive cybersecurity field as well as the broader category of manufacturing and supply chain cybersecurity field. Graduates may also find employment in the utilities and finance sectors.
While incidents of cyber-attacks in the automotive manufacturing sector have notably increased in recent years, many companies are not prepared or do not have significant processes in place to identify or respond to security breaches. It has been determined that ISO/SAE 21434 will be the international industry standard used as the baseline for vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to ensure cybersecurity risks are managed. This will lead to an increased demand for cybersecurity specialists in the automotive manufacturing sector. Windsor-Essex has positioned itself to be able to lead the way in automotive, and manufacturing cybersecurity and to become a hub within the industry.

Graduates are eligible as a candidate for the National Dental Hygiene Certification Examination. Successful completion is a requirement for registration by the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario to practice in the province.

Program Overview
Diagnostic Cardiac Sonographers (DCS) utilize high-frequency sound waves to assist physicians in making heart health diagnoses. They perform sonographic procedures on the heart and determine which images to submit for review to the primary care physician. This graduate certificate program would be of interest to graduates of applied health science programs such as Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Cardiovascular Technology, Nursing and Human Kinetics.
The Diagnostic Cardiac Sonography program will prepare students to develop theoretical and clinical competency skills required in the field of cardiac sonography and will also allow them to gain extensive laboratory and clinical experience, utilizing state-of-the-art equipment.
Program Highlights

This hybrid program is offered mostly as online lectures and in-person labs in the afternoon/evenings/weekends.
Students who have previously graduated from the Diagnostic Medical Sonography program or Cardiovascular Technology program may be eligible for transfer credits.
This is a fast-track program to be completed in 16 months of continuous study. The program includes 2 semesters of mostly online lectures and in-person labs, followed by 2 semesters of clinical placements.
The program will allow students to participate in two 12-week semesters of clinical training and meet the competencies outlined in the Sonography Canada National Competency Profile (NCP).

Accreditation
St. Clair College's Diagnostic Cardiac Sonography program was granted a two-year Accredited with condition status in 2022, through EQual - ACCREDITATION CANADA. Students must graduate from an accredited educational program to qualify to complete the Sonography Canada credentialing examinations and register with the College of Medical Radiation and Imaging Technologists of Ontario (CMRITO) to be eligible to work in Ontario.
Career Opportunities
Diagnostic cardiac sonographers operate ultrasound equipment and use non-invasive cardiovascular technology equipment to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with heart and blood vessel conditions. They perform echocardiograms, or ultrasound imaging, to evaluate different aspects of the heart such as chamber size, valve function, and blood flow and to produce and record images of the cardiac system. While diagnostic cardiac sonographers do not diagnose patients, they work with physicians in doing so and may assist in other diagnostic procedures.
Graduates of this continuous 16-month certificate program may work in hospitals, medical offices, private clinics, and independent cardiac testing centres.



Admission Requirements
Applicants must possess one of the following qualifications:

A graduate of a registered health professions Diploma or Advanced Diploma program

Examples of registered health professions Diploma or Advanced Diploma programs include but are not limited to Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Medical Radiation Technology, Respiratory Therapist, Registered Practical Nursing, Cardiovascular Technology, Registered Massage Therapy, Occupational Therapy Assistant and Physiotherapy Assistant


A graduate of a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a medical or health-related discipline with successful completion of six credit hours in Human Anatomy and Physiology, or equivalent, and six credit hours in health care-related courses (Ex: Patient Care, Medical Research, Medical Ethics, etc.)

Examples of medical or health-related degrees include but are not limited to BSc Kinesiology, BA Kinesiology, BSc Nursing, Bachelor of Medical Radiation Technology, Bachelor of Applied Health Sciences, MSc OT, and MSc PT



For more information, see the Diagnostic Cardiac Sonography Admission Requirements document also found on the Admission Procedures page.
Selection Procedure
Please note: This program is deemed "oversubscribed". As a result of the limited number of seats available.
Applicants who have completed a related health science program will be ranked utilizing their program GPA from their previous related health science degree or diploma. We will not include those courses related to Pre-Health Sciences program that were completed to gain admission into a health sciences program. Please note an official letter from your previous academic institution stating your program GPA may be requested.
Computer Proficiency Requirements
Students in this program must have basic computer literacy, which includes word processing, spreadsheets, Internet, and e-mail.
